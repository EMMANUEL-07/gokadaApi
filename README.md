WELCOME. LET'S GET STARTED.


This is a sample demo on the task given.

I have tried to use as little functionality as possible.

I kept it as a 1 pager, didnt want to require you switching between many pages while perusing, I hope you dont mind the code being long.

Also cleaned up the console so its not crowded and can be convenient for use.

Link to frontEnd(React) project repo is : https://github.com/EMMANUEL-07/gokadaDemo

Kindly clone or copy into your htdocs folder( or its corresponding folder for other solution stacks) and run follow the required proedures for executing a cloned laravel project. 

I hope its good enough. Thank you.
